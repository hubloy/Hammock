# README

A [WordPress Membership](https://wordpress.org/plugins/memberships-by-hubloy/) plugin.

The **only** development branchis `master`. This branch ultimately is responsible for creating the production branches that are finally published.

**Remember:** `master` is the ONLY branch that should be edited and forked!

**Notes:** 

1. ONLY fork and submit pull-requests to the master branch `master`!
2. NEVER fork the production branches (below)!
3. NEVER publish/release the master branch `master` anywhere!


-----

# DEVELOPMENT

As mentioned above: Only directly edit the branch `master`. Other branches should be only updated via grunt tasks (see section "Automation" below).

Important: Do not let your IDE change the **source order** of the code. Fixing up formatting is fine, but moving code blocks around is not! It will confuse grunt and produce problems.

## Working with the branches

### JS and CSS files

Only edit/create javascript and css files inside the `_src` folders:

* `_src/js/*` for javascript.
* `_src/scss/*` for css. Use .scss extension (SASS)!
* `_src/react/*` for react. Use .jsx and .js extension!

Important: Those folders are scanned and processed when running webpack and gulp. Files in base of `assets/js/` and `assets/css/` are ****overwritten****.


### Folder structure

Plugin code:

* `app/` .. All code of the core goes here.
* `assets/` .. contains all images, js, css and font files.
> *Special folders inside asset:*
>  `_src/js/` (source js-files)
>  `_src/js/` (source scss-files)
>  `_src/react/` (source react-files)
>  
* `templates/` .. Theme template files.
* `tests/` .. contains PHP Unit Tests (run by grunt).

Files in these folders should not be modified directly:

* `languages/` .. contains .pot translation files (generated by grunt, do not modify).

# AUTOMATION

See notes below on how to correctly set up and use grunt. 

Many tasks as well as basic quality control are done via grunt. Below is a list of supported tasks.


### Grunt Task Runner  

**ALWAYS** use Grunt to build the production branches. Use the following commands:  

Category | Command | Action
---------| ------- | ------
Build | `gulp build` | Build CSS and JS files.
Build | `npm run build` | Package and build plugin.
Build | `npm run react-build` | Run react build in dev mode.
Build | `npm run react-prod` | Build production ready react scripts
